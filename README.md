    CAPSTONE PROJECT 



- Document the development process and explain the decisions made.


- Student creates a project board and utilizes board for communication with mentor
 by keeping it up-to-date throughout project. Student plans for MVP using user
 flow charts, wireframes, and/or schema designs.

- Code is documented/commented and follows coding standards.

- App is successfully deployed before the project due date

- All relevant repos have README with project description, endpoint documentation,
 links to production sites, and instructions to setup. It is formatted clearly
 and consistently.

- One project board (e.g., Trello, Github Project Board, etc.) to track
  stories/features and progress

-  Project board should include MVP user stories and provide a means of 
   prioritizing features, tracking progress on particular tasks/features
    - Workflow organization and tracking process is clear (e.g., board has columns
      for the backlog, to-do items, in-progress, review, and done columns)
    - Features and tasks are clearly defined and prioritized to create MVP
      (e.g., implements user stories ordered based on priority)
    - Can include user flow diagrams, wireframes, and/or database planning visuals
      or schemas
    - Should be kept up-to-date


## Back-End Expectations


- Authentication is set up with JWT and bcrypt
- There are register, login, and logout routes
- There are three or more collections
- There are protected routes (accessed only with JWT)
- Full CRUD functionality is implemented for at least one collection
- All routes work as expected
- All errors are handled


## Front-End Expectations

- Interfaces with the backend API
- One or more views are login protected (i.e., at least one page cannot be viewed
  or used by a user who is not logged in)
- UI is broken up into small, reusable components
- Components follow the single-responsibility principle (component should only do
  one thing)
- Components contain logic to control the UI, but do not include business logic.


## Stretch Goal Expectations

- The project incorporates at least **1** stretch goal:
    - Implement a library, technology, or concept that you have not learned before
      (please discuss with your mentor)
    - Implement frontend in a framework you have not used before in a project
    - Implement PostgreSQL
    - Implement Redux or another state management system as your global state
      manager
    - Implement WebSockets (e.g., **[socket.io](https://socket.io/)**)
    - Implement Docker
    - Implement connection to a cloud platform and use cloud operations (e.g., 
      AWS - upload content )
    - Implement microservices
    - Implement a unit, integration, and/or end-to-end testing framework
    - Other (please discuss with your mentor)
